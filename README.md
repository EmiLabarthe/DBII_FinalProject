## Emiliano Labarthe - Manuel Mongelós - Felipe Villaronga

Final project from Databases II at Universidad Católica del Uruguay.

# Description:
Interactive web platform for university students to participate in a "penca" (prediction game) for the Copa America 2024. The main focus of the project was on the modeling and design of the database, applying efficiency techniques and making strategic decisions during the definition of entities and relationships. Additionally, all database queries were manually written.

## What is a Penca?
A "penca" is a competition where students predict the outcomes of various matches. Each prediction earns the student a certain number of points based on the actual result of the respective match and the accuracy of their prediction. These points are accumulated throughout the tournament, and the student with the highest total at the end of the event is declared the winner. This type of game fosters engagement and excitement as participants compete to showcase their sports knowledge and prediction skills.
